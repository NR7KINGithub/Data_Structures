# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from LeetCode. The solutions are implemented in **Python**, **Python3**, **Java**, and **C++**.  

## Topics 
- **Arrays**  
- **Linked Lists**  
- **Binary Search**  
- **Heaps**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **String**  
- **Binary Tree**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- More To Come!

This repository will be continuously updated as I solve more DSA problems on LeetCode.
Browse through folders named by problem topics.  
Happy Coding! :)
